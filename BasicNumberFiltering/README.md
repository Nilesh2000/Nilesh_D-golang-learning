# BasicNumberFiltering

1. **Checkpoint 1**

   - Started off with a barebones implementation for stories 1 to 6
   - Defined a main function, initialized a slice, wrote helper methods to check for odd, even and return slices
   - Single file, no helper methods.
   - Does not allow input.
   - Outputs everything to stdout.
   - No test driven development

2. **Checkpoint 2**

   - Initialized Project using go mod init <project_name>
   - Created a main_test.go file.
   - Implemented tests by calling the method within the test and checking if the resultant slice satisfies the divisibility criteria.
   - Did it for two methods and figured this is probably not the best way. Felt like I was repeating a lot of code.
